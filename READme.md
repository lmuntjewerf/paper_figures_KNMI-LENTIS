## How to organise this repo?
This repo contains the scripts that were used for producing the figures, tables and number of the KNMI-LENTIS datapaper. The repo is organised following the sections of the paper. 

### Section 2 - set-up
- figure 1: overview
- calculation of ECE3_bis 
	- GMST mean and stddev for hist and ssp245.  
	- timing year mean and stddev of timing when ss245 reaches +2K

### Section 3 - limitations
- table 1: quantification of timerature difference and ensemble spread (mean and std.)
- figure 2: model bias
- table 2: model bias
- figure 3: forced climate signal within a time slice
- figure 4: range of sampled internal varibility
- figures 5 and 6: legacy of mirco perturbations

### Section 4 - demonstration
- figure 7: ensemble climatological context
- figure 8: extreme meteorological event
- figure 9: compound event
- figure 10: climate-impact modelling
