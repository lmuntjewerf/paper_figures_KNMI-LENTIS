This repo contains the scripts that were used for producing the figures, tables and number of the [KNMI-LENTIS datapaper](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-4581-2023).

### Section 2 - set-up
- **Figure 1. Overview of KNMI–LENTIS setup.**
(a) Global mean surface temperature (GMST) of the 16 ECE3p5 ensemble members forced
with CMIP6 historical and SSP2-4.5 forcing. Pink shading shows the two time slices in KNMI–LENTIS. (b) Part of the time slice setup.
From each of the 16 parent runs (grey), 10 KNMI–LENTIS simulations (pink) are branched using unique seeds to make a micro-perturbation
in the atmospheric initial conditions. (c) The full ensemble consists of two time slices of 10 years with 1600 years of data each: the present
day (PD) and present day C2K global warming (2 K). The parents are visualized by the grey (historical) and blue (SSP2-4.5) lines. The
KNMI–LENTIS simulations are visualized by the pink lines.
